V1.0

- Added tab header
- About, Explore, Cases tabs added
- reset button now resets table and orders selected, but leaves the location as whatever the user had selected previously
- moved the selectizeinput for orders to the server side
	- was suggested by R to improve performance and it did
	- watch for weird text processing issues (Radiologic --> riologic, idk why but resloved with refreshing app)
- Change from sidepanel layout to fluid page which allows for more flexibility.
- Calculator had to be recreated for the cases, had to create second table, values, location etc (all inputs and outputs needed a modification to show up properly)
